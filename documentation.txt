Documentation for Haskell Poisson modeller
"Pwaskell"

Theory:
Poisson distribtions model the incidence of high numbers of independent random
incidents in a time (or space) series of epochs, or episodes, with a constant
probaility.  For example, in any 8 hour shifts a doctor may receieve 20 
phonecalls on average. It may 19, or 21, but 20 is most likely. 17 is less so and 0, and 40, are much less likely.

Haskell is a functional language.  Whereas Python and other object oriented
languages take "things" and "add bits on", and so are like lego, Haskell is like "marble run" or a domino run.  The thought goes into a continuous process and tthe relatively simple objects elements are not the focus. 

Intent:
Set an integer number of episodes
Set an approximate number of incidents per episode

Current state of code:
 do

:l rand_ex.hs

then

take 3 (randomlist 2)

So that gives 3 from a lzaily contructed infintei list of flaots from seed 2.
